This is a simple shell that uses execvp to execute commands, with cd functionality. Use on a unix system in the terminal

The shell command './configure && make && make install' should configure, build, and install this package from the .tar.gz file

It can then be run by the shell command: ./shell

To write to a file, just do $ (your command) > filename where filename is the name of your desired destination file.

Doing CTRL + C will not exit the shell program

any command before or after CTRL + C will be ingnored
